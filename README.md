## Introduction

* As the part of Introduction I have learned the basics of ML.
* Problems that can be solved usign ML.
* How datasets are structured in SKlearn.
* How to use ML Algorithms that are present in SKLearn.
* How to devide the dataset into training and testing set with "train_test_split" function.
* How to check efficiency of an algorithm.

* And lastly created a small project ```Iris Flower Classification``` model.

**Machine Learning Algorithms are of 2 types - ```Supervised Learning``` and ```Unsupervised Learning```**

## Supervised Learning

* There are mainly two types of Algorithms in Supervised Learning - ***Classification*** and ***Regression***.
* *Classification* is something in which we have a set of predefined outputs and these outputs are called classes.
* *Regression* is something in which we don't have a set of expected/predefined o/p rather we have a range and we expect our model to answer in the given range. 
	* for example we are calculating anual income of a person depending upon his/her qualifications and the area they live in. If the monthly income of that person is 40000 and our model preicts 39999 or 40001 then it would be considered as a correct prediction. But this is not in the case of classification.
* Our model has 3 types of states - **Generalized**, **Overfit**, **underfit**
* **Generalized** means that the model is good for any data i.e. it can predict with higher accuracy in the testing environment.
* **Overfit** means the model is very good in the training environment but is not performing well in the test environment.
* **Underfit** means the model is not performing well even in the training environment.

> More the datapoints you provide more accurate the result is.
